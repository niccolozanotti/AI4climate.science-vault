description: Welcome to Niccolò Zanotti website about AI and climate science
---

This website stems from the notes I am taking using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking system. 

_As of now_ it holds:
- my [[Notes|University notes]] with the main topics being [[AI|Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Climate|Climate science]] (📓Notes in the header)
- My personal [[Projects|projects]]
- [[Miscellaneous|Miscellanea]]

The full list of reference books/articles can be found [[References|here]].

### How to navigate the website

As in Obsidian, from the [Graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view) in the bottom panel - or in the right panel if in full screen mode - you can navigate the website through linked notes. 

You can also search the notes using the website 🔍 button or by Ctrl+k. You can search for the notes with a certain tag with #tag-name (see [[/tags|here]] the full tag list).
