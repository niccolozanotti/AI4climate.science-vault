>[!info]- Learning outcomes
> At the end of the course the student knows and understands:
> - the motivation and the components of the Data Mining process; 
> - the general concepts, technologies and methodologies of Data Warehouse, OLAP and Data Lake, as enabling factors of the Data Mining process; 
> - the principles and the most relevant use cases of a wide set of Machine Learning algorithms which are used to extract relevant and actionable information from large amounts of data. 
>
> At the end of the course the student is able to: 
> - design the main steps of a Data Mining process 
> - choose the Machine Learning methods best suited for the process 
> - evaluate the quality of the result in order to support strategic and operational decisions.

## Exam

The Verification of knowledge is tested through multiple choice questions. The minimum to pass is to answer correctly half + 1 of the questions. The weight of this part is 33%.

The Verification of abilities will be tested in lab with the development of a program for the execution of a Machine Learning task on an assigned data set. The quality of the solution will be evaluated on the basis of the correctness of the approach, the correctness of the solution, the quality of the coding and of the documentation. The minimum to pass is to give a sensible approach and a reasonable coding. The weight of this part is 67%
