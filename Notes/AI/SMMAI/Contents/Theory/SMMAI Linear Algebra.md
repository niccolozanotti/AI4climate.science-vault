## Matrices

Matrices play a central role in linear algebra. They can be used to compactly represent systems of linear equations, but they also represent [[SMMAI Linear Algebra#Linear Mappings|linear mappings]].

Before we discuss some of these interesting topics, let us first define what a matrix is and what kind of operations we can do with matrices. 

>[!definition] Matrix
> With $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ a real-valued $(m,n)$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is an $m \cdot n$-tuple of elements $a_{ij}, i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, n$, which is ordered according to a rectangular scheme consisting of $m$ rows and $n$ columns:
> $$
>  \mathbf{A} = 
>  \begin{bmatrix}
>      a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ 
>      a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\
>       \vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\ 
>      a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn} 
> \end{bmatrix}
> , a_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}
> $$
> By convention $(1,n)$-matrices are called *rows* and $(m,1)$-matrices are called *columns*.
