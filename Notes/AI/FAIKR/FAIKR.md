>[!info]- Course Description
> The course introduces the fundamental principles and methods used in Artificial Intelligence to solve problems, with a special focus on the search in the state space, planning, knowledge representation and reasoning, and on the methods for dealing with uncertain knowledge. The course will include hands-on labs and seminars on selected topics.
>
> *Prerequisites*: user-level knowledge of a high-level programming language, in order to successfully understand case studies and applications presented during the lessons.
