description: >
  The student will learn the conceptual basis of earth system modelling and its major components. The student will learn how the atmospheric, oceanic, cryogenic and ecosystems components can be modelled separately and how they can be coupled using examples from state-of-the-art models. The student will be exposed to strategies to design numerical experiments, verification and validation procedures using both ensemble techniques and probabilistic approaches. At the end of the course, the student will have a grasp of logic and rationale framing of earth system modelling, and will develop a capacity to design numerical experiments and a critical understanding of the verification and validation procedures.
