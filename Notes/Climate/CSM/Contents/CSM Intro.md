**For centuries** individuals have dreamed of being able to understand **how the climate system works** and from that understanding, being able to forecast and perhaps even modify the future climate. This distant goal has become more approachable as a result of the **invention of the modern electronic computer** in the mid-twentieth century. With the computer, it is now possible to **solve numerically many of the equations** encapsulating the **physical laws** that govern climate. This provides us with exciting new possibilities but also new dangers, and it is important to move with caution, being careful to understand the **limitations** as well as the **potentials** of our new capabilities.

#### Climate's Economic Impact

**Improved understanding of the climate system** could have substantial impact on the **economic well-being** of the nations of the world. For instance, **better predictions of future climate states** could help determine more opportune times for **planting and harvesting crops** and in the appropriate warning of **possible environmental harm** from human activities such as **deforestation** and the insertion of **carbon dioxide**, other **trace gases**, and **human-created aerosols** into the Earth's atmosphere.

On **time scales of months to years**, many uncertainties about climate change remain, which could be expected to lessen as **computer modeling studies** advance. For instance, unknown factors include the **full climatic impacts** of **ocean temperature anomalies** occurring during **El Niño and La Niña episodes** and the full impacts of **volcanic eruptions** on **ozone amounts** in the **stratosphere** and on **atmospheric cooling**, arising from the particles volcanoes insert that reflect **sunlight back** out of the Earth/atmosphere system.

#### Computer Models and Complex Interactions

Recently, scientists have begun exploring concerns about changes in **ecology** brought about by **biomass burning** and **deforestation**. These changes can be examined using **climate models** with **interactive chemistry cycles**. Without computer climate models, it would be extremely difficult to give **quantitative answers** to the questions raised by these varied issues, as the interactions are so **complex**.

**Over the past half-century**, computer models have become **powerful investigative tools** for climate research. They will almost certainly become even more so in the future, as the **observational database improves** both in quality and spatial coverage, with **expanded satellite** and **conventional data networks**, and as **procedures** are further developed for **assimilating the data** into numerical models.

#### The Development of Predictive Theories

The realization that the **physical laws governing the atmosphere, oceans, and other components of the climate system** could be used to **determine future conditions** was inherent in the philosophical reasoning of the **late eighteenth** and **early nineteenth centuries**. Following the early success of **Newtonian mechanics**, **Pierre Simon de Laplace** in 1812 suggested that complete knowledge of **masses, positions, and velocities of all particles** would enable precise calculations of **past and future events**.

By the late 1800s, the **fundamental laws of classical physics** were known, and thus the goal of **accurate prediction** through **numerical calculation** became closer to realization.
#### Bjerknes' Forecasting Problems

[Vilhelm Bjerknes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilhelm_Bjerknes)(1862-1951) planned a course of action that remains valid today:
> *If it is true, as every scientist believes, that subsequent atmospheric states develop from the preceding ones according to physical law, then it is apparent that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the rational solution of forecasting problems are the following:*
> *1. A sufficiently accurate knowledge of the state of the atmosphere at the initial time.*
> *2. A sufficiently accurate knowledge of the laws according to which one state of the atmosphere develops from another.*
> 
> Vilhem Bjerknes (1904)

#### Early Numerical Weather Predictions

During **World War I**, while resting between battles as a **volunteer ambulance driver** for the **Red Cross**, [Lewis Fry Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson) attempted to use the **basic equations of atmospheric motions** to develop **weather forecasting** using only a **mechanical calculator**.

Richardson's **book** ([[@Richardson1922|Richardson, 1922]]) in many ways serves as a blueprint for constructing a **numerical model**. Many of the problems Richardson encountered are the same ones **climate and weather modelers** continue to face today. **Climate models** now can simulate **most major observed features** of the atmosphere, oceans, and cryosphere.

#### Modern Advancements in Modeling

Little progress was made after Richardson until the late **1940s**, when the first **electronic computers** like the **Atanasoff-Berry Computer** (ABC) and **ENIAC** emerged. These were used by **John von Neumann** and his team to address **weather pattern forecasting**.

The **computer program** that Charney and others tested for their **numerical weather prediction** used **simplified equations**, solving for **weather patterns** that filtered out **unwanted waves** in the atmosphere.

By the **mid-1950s**, several groups of scientists dedicated to the development of **numerical weather prediction** and **general circulation modeling** of the atmosphere were formed.
