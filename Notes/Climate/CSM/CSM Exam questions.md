## Oral Exam

- He tends to ask about topics and formulas in detail, but small inaccuracies are not heavily penalized.
- He can change subjects suddenly if he senses knowledge on a topic.
1. **Second question of the written test:**  
   Topics: Navier-Stokes components, thermodynamic equations, which terms are important, when and where, and how we use them in models.
