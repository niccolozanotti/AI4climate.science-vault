## Two level schemes

Involving two time levels
$$
 \frac{dU}{dt} = f(U,t) \hspace{1cm} U^{(n)} \to U(n \Delta t)
$$

$f$ is normally called **tendency**, i.e. the time-derivative.

Euler forward scheme:
$$
 U^{(n+1)} = U^{(n)}+ \Delta t f^{(n)}
$$
explicit scheme.
Euler backward scheme 
$$
 U^{(n+1)} = U^{(n)}+ \Delta t f^{(n+1)}
$$
has a 'problem' since it is an implicit scheme
